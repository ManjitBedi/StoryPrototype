==============

Note: this code is a bit old;  I intend to update it over the next few months.

I have a conudrum.  Using Twine would be good but the newest version of the Twine editor
does not support the Twee file format which is a plain text format.

The other decision to make is how to handle the display of text and handling of tapping on links.
There is an open source project on Cocoapods that could help here:

The goal is to create a reusable engine for iOS that can load content created using Twine.
