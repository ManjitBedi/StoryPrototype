StoryPrototype
==============

Note: this code is a bit old;  I intend to update it over the next few months.

The initial work was creating an iOS app that will read in the Twee text file format used by Twine.

With the newer version of Twine there are now 3 formats.  I plan to look into adding support for Hawlowe.

The goal is to create reusable engine that can load branching stories created using Twine.
